**Computer project: "Chop'INT aka "Tinder of INT"**

The aim of this project was to create an alternative to Tinder for Télécom SudParis and IMT-BS. 

In this project, we developed a specific match algorithm based on a combination of distance comparison methods to obtain a maximum match rate between similar profiles based on criteria associated with the school.

As project manager, I participated in the development of the algorithm. I designed and implemented the infrastructure. And I made sure that the specifications were respected and that the project was carried out correctly.

Chop'INT is also a multiplatform mobile application developed for this project.
